          <h2 class="title-blog-2">The Origins of Volleyball</h2>
          <p class="blog2-content">
            Volleyball was invented in 1895 by William G. Morgan, a physical
            education instructor at the YMCA in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
            Originally named "Mintonette," Morgan created the game as a less
            physically demanding alternative to basketball, which had been
            invented just a few years earlier. His goal was to provide an
            activity that could be enjoyed by older members of the YMCA,
            blending elements from basketball, baseball, tennis, and handball.
            Morgan's new game quickly caught on, but it wasn't until a
            demonstration at a YMCA conference in 1896 that it received the name
            "volleyball." The name was suggested after participants noticed how
            the ball was constantly "volleyed" back and forth over the net.
          </p>
          <h2 class="title-blog-2">Volleyball's Path to International Fame</h2>
          <p>
            After its invention, volleyball spread rapidly, especially through
            YMCA branches worldwide. By the 1910s, it had gained popularity
            across Europe and Asia, particularly in countries like the
            Philippines, where local adaptations such as spiking were
            introduced, enhancing the sport's excitement. In 1947, the
            International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) was established, marking
            a pivotal moment for the sport's international growth. Just five
            years later, the first Volleyball World Championship was held,
            further cementing its global status. Volleyball's Entry into the
            Olympic Games The biggest leap for volleyball came in 1964 when it
            was officially included in the Tokyo Olympic Games. Its inclusion
            was a major milestone for the sport, providing a platform for
            volleyball to showcase its competitive nature and athleticism on the
            world stage. Since then, volleyball has remained a staple of the
            Summer Olympics, with both indoor and beach volleyball becoming
            crowd favorites. The sport's Olympic presence has brought it immense
            international recognition and inspired generations of athletes to
            pursue the game at the highest level.

          <h1>The Impact of Volleyball’s Olympic Status</h1>
          <h3>
            The inclusion of volleyball in the Olympics elevated the sport to
            new heights, providing several key benefits:
          </h3>

            <li>
              <p>
                Increased Popularity: The global exposure offered by the
                Olympics allowed volleyball to grow in popularity, particularly
                in regions where it had previously been less known.

            <li>
              <p>
                Development of Professional Leagues: Olympic volleyball inspired
                the creation of professional leagues across the world, including
                the Italian, Brazilian, and Japanese leagues, all of which
                feature top-tier players.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Improved Access and Inclusion: With its Olympic spotlight,
                volleyball became a more accessible sport, attracting diverse
                players from various countries. The beach volleyball version,
                introduced in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, also expanded the
                sport’s appeal to a younger and more casual audience.

            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Increased Gender Equity: Volleyball has been one of the leading
                sports in promoting gender equity, with both men's and women's
                competitions given equal billing at the Olympics, further
                encouraging participation from all genders.
